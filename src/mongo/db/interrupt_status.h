       Abstraction for checking on interrupt status.

       The killCurrentOp object (currently declared in curop.h, and defined
       in instance.cpp) can only be referenced within mongod.  This abstraction
       serves to isolate that so that code that runs in both mongod and mongos
       can be linked without unresolved symbols.  There is a concrete
       implementation of this class for mongod which references killCurrentOp,
       and another implementation for mongos which does not (currently, it
       does nothing, but that should be fixed).
