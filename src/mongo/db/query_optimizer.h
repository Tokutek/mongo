     * @return a cursor interface to the query optimizer.  The implementation may utilize a
     * single query plan or interleave results from multiple query plans before settling on a
     * single query plan.  Note that the schema of currKey() documents, indexKeyPattern(), the
     * matcher(), and the isMultiKey() nature of the cursor may change over the course of
     * iteration.
     *
     * @param query - Query used to select indexes and populate matchers; not copied if unowned
     * (see bsonobj.h).
     *
     * @param order - Required ordering spec for documents produced by this cursor, empty object
     * default indicates no order requirement.  If no index exists that satisfies the required
     * sort order, an empty shared_ptr is returned unless parsedQuery is also provided.  This is
     * not copied if unowned.
     *
     * @param planPolicy - A policy for selecting query plans - see queryoptimizercursor.h
     *
     * @param requestMatcher - Set to true to request that the returned Cursor provide a
     * matcher().  If false, the cursor's matcher() may return NULL if the Cursor can perform
     * accurate query matching internally using a non Matcher mechanism.  One case where a
     * Matcher might be requested even though not strictly necessary to select matching
     * documents is if metadata about matches may be requested using MatchDetails.  NOTE This is
     * a hint that the Cursor use a Matcher, but the hint may be ignored.  In some cases the
     * returned cursor may not provide a matcher even if 'requestMatcher' is true.
     *
     * @param parsedQuery - Additional query parameters, as from a client query request.
     *
     * @param requireOrder - If false, the resulting cursor may return results in an order
     * inconsistent with the @param order spec.  See queryoptimizercursor.h for information on
     * handling these results properly.
     *
     * @param singlePlanSummary - Query plan summary information that may be provided when a
     * cursor running a single plan is returned.
     *
     * The returned cursor may @throw inside of advance() or recoverFromYield() in certain error
     * cases, for example if a capped overrun occurred during a yield.  This indicates that the
     * cursor was unable to perform a complete scan.
     *
     * This is a work in progress.  Partial list of features not yet implemented through this
     * interface:
     * 
     * - covered indexes
     * - in memory sorting
