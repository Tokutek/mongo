     *
     *        1. 'off' - disable fail point.
     *        2. 'alwaysOn' - fail point is always active.
     *        3. { period: <n> } - n should be within the range of a 32 bit signed
     *            integer and this would be the approximate period for every activation.
     *            For example, for { period: 120 }, the probability of the fail point to
     *            be activated is 1 in 120. NOT YET SUPPORTED.
     *        4. { times: <n> } - n should be positive and within the range of a 32 bit
     *            signed integer and this is the number of passes on the fail point will
     *            remain activated.
