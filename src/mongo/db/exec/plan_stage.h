    /**
     * A PlanStage ("stage") is the basic building block of a "Query Execution Plan."  A stage is
     * the smallest piece of machinery used in executing a compiled query.  Stages either access
     * data (from a collection or an index) to create a stream of results, or transform a stream of
     * results (e.g. AND, OR, SORT) to create a stream of results.  
     *
     * Stages have zero or more input streams but only one output stream.  Data-accessing stages are
     * leaves and data-transforming stages have children.  Stages can be connected together to form
     * a tree which is then executed (see plan_runner.h) to solve a query.  
     *
     * A stage's input and output are each typed.  Only stages with compatible types can be
     * connected.
     *
     * All of the stages of a QEP share a WorkingSet (see working_set.h).  Data source stages
     * allocate a slot in the WorkingSet, fill the slot with data, and return the ID of that slot.
     * Subsequent stages fetch a WorkingSetElement by its ID and operate on the enclosed data.
     *
     * Stages do nothing unless work() is called.  work() is a request to the stage to consume one
     * unit of input.  Some stages (e.g. AND, SORT) require many calls to work() before generating
     * output as they must consume many units of input.  These stages will inform the caller that
     * they need more time, and work() must be called again in order to produce an output.
     *
     * Every stage of a query implements the PlanStage interface.  Queries perform a unit of work
     * and report on their subsequent status; see StatusCode for possible states.  Query results are
     * passed through the WorkingSet interface; see working_set.h for details.
     *
     * All synchronization is the responsibility of the caller.  Queries must be told to yield with
     * prepareToYield() if any underlying database state changes.  If prepareToYield() is called,
     * recoverFromYield() must be called again before any work() is done.
     *
     * Here is a very simple usage example:
     *
     * WorkingSet workingSet;
     * PlanStage* rootStage = makeQueryPlan(&workingSet, ...);
     * while (!rootStage->isEOF()) {
     *     WorkingSetID result;
     *     switch(rootStage->work(&result)) {
     *     case PlanStage::ADVANCED:
     *         // do something with result
     *         WorkingSetMember* member = workingSet.get(result);
     *         cout << "Result: " << member->obj << endl;
     *         break;
     *     case PlanStage::IS_EOF:
     *         // All done.  Will fall out of while loop.
     *         break;
     *     case PlanStage::NEED_TIME:
     *         // Need more time.
     *         break;
     *     case PlanStage::ERROR:
     *         // Throw exception or return error
     *         break;
     *     case PlanStage::NEED_FETCH:
     *         // Go to disk and fetch stuff.
     *         break;
     *     }
     *
     *     if (shouldYield) {
     *         // Occasionally yield.
     *         stage->prepareToYield();
     *         // Do work that requires a yield here (execute other plans, insert, delete, etc.).
     *         stage->recoverFromYield();
     *     }
     * }
