########################################################################
# PROCESS OPTIONS

# Where to store the data.
#
# Note: if you run tokumx as a non-root user (recommended) you may
# need to create and set permissions for this directory manually,
# e.g., if the parent directory isn't mutable by the tokumx user.
dbpath=/var/lib/tokumx

# Where to log informational and debugging messages.
logpath=/var/log/tokumx/tokumx.log

# Use the syslog facility instead of a log file.
#syslog=false

# Append entries to the log rather than rotating old logs out.
logappend=true

# Port to accept client connections.
#port=27017

# Listen to local interface only. Comment out to listen on all interfaces.
bind_ip=127.0.0.1

# fork and run in background
#fork=false

# location of pidfile (default: no pidfile)
#pidfilepath=/var/run/tokumx/tokumx.pid

# Where to find plugins
pluginsDir=/usr/lib/tokumx/plugins

# FRACTAL TREE STORAGE OPTIONS

# Amount of memory (in bytes) used to cache documents and indexes in
# memory, uncompressed.  Value can be specified with K/M/G/T suffix.
# Default is half of physical memory, determined at startup.
#cacheSize=8G

# Use direct I/O to access data on disk, bypassing the kernel page
# cache.  When using direct I/O, it is usually good to set cacheSize
# higher (around 80% of physical memory).  Out-of-memory workloads
# typically perform better with direct I/O on and a larger cacheSize.
#directio=false

# Flush the recovery log every logFlushPeriod milliseconds (similar to
# journalCommitInterval in vanilla mongodb).  Unlike vanilla mongodb,
# logFlushPeriod=0 means flush after every operation commit, which can
# be slow.  getLastError commands with {j:1} force this flush.  Valid
# values are 0-300ms, default is 100ms.
#logFlushPeriod=100

# Directory where the recovery log (similar to mongodb durability
# journal) is stored.
#logDir=<same as dbpath>

# Directory where TokuMX will place temporary files used by the bulk
# loader for building collections and indexes (used by mongorestore,
# mongoimport, and non-background index creation).
#tmpDir=<same as dbpath>

########################################################################
# REPLICATION OPTIONS

# in replica set configuration, specify the name of the replica set
#replSet=setname

# How many days of oplog data to keep.  If a secondary falls more than
# this many days behind, it will need to resync.
#expireOplogDays=14

# Path to a key file storing authentication info for connections
# between replica set members
#keyFile=/path/to/keyfile

########################################################################
# MISC OPTIONS

# Enables periodic logging of CPU utilization and I/O wait
#cpu=true

# Turn on/off security.  Off is currently the default
#noauth=true
#auth=true

# Verbose logging output.
#verbose=true

# Inspect all client data for validity on receipt (useful for
# developing drivers)
#objcheck=true

# Enable db quota management
#quota=true

# Set oplogging level where n is
#   0=off (default)
#   1=W
#   2=R
#   3=both
#   7=W+some reads
#diaglog=0

# Ignore query hints
#nohints=true

# Disable the HTTP interface (Defaults to localhost:28017).
#nohttpinterface=true

# Turns off server-side scripting.  This will result in greatly limited
# functionality
#noscripting=true

# Turns off table scans.  Any query that would do a table scan fails.
#notablescan=true

########################################################################
# ADVANCED FRACTAL TREE STORAGE OPTIONS

#
# In most cases, these options should be left at their default settings.
#

# Number of milliseconds that a transaction will wait for a lock held by
# another transaction to be released.  If the conflicting transaction
# does not release the lock within the lock timeout, the transaction
# that was waiting for the lock will get a lock timeout error.  A value
# of 0 disables lock waiting.
#lockTimeout=4000

# Amount of memory (in bytes) used by the tree that tracks
# document-level locking.  Default value is 10% of cacheSize (this
# memory is taken in addition to the cache, not taken from the cache's
# allowance).
#locktreeMaxMemory=800M

# Amount of memory (in bytes) used by the bulk loader when a bulk load
# is active.
#loaderMaxMemory=100M

# Time in seconds between the start of consecutive checkpoints.
#checkpointPeriod=60

# Time in seconds between consecutive cleaner thread runs.  0 disables
# the cleaner thread.
#cleanerPeriod=2

# How many nodes to flush on each run of the cleaner thread.  0 disables
# cleaner threads.
#cleanerIterations=5

# Percentage of the filesystem's size that must be free to allow inserts
# and updates.  If free space falls below this percentage, the database
# will go into read-only mode.
#fsRedzone=5

# Only affects replica sets.  Amount in bytes of oplog data a
# transaction will store in memory before spilling the data to disk in
# the local.oplog.refs collection.  Maximum value is 2MB.
#txnMemLimit=1M

# Whether the bulk loader (used by mongoimport/mongorestore and
# non-background index builds) compresses intermediate files before
# writing to disk.  These are the intermediate files that are written
# in tmpDir (see above).
#loaderCompressTmp=true
